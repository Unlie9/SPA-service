##### Django Channels with WebSockets to enable real-time, bidirectional communication, powering features such as live updates without the need for page reloads.

##### PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing application data.

##### Redis for channel layer binding in WebSockets, ensuring efficient real-time message distribution.

##### The project is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy scalability and consistent development environments.

##### AWS hosts the application for cloud-based deployment, while Nginx serves as the reverse proxy to efficiently handle static files and requests.
